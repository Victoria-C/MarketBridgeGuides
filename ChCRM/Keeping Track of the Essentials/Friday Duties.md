# Friday Duties

###To prepare for the upcoming week try to complete the following tasks on Fridays:

#### Updating Agendas:
Look at all of the partner calls for the following week and update their corresponding agendas (/previous meetings's notes) with any relevant information. The agendas are NOT sent out on Friday, just prepped to be sent out the following week. 


#### Updating Weekly Trello:
Trello updates should happen more frequently than once a week, however, moving "upcoming" Trello cards to "this week" should be done on Fridays.
